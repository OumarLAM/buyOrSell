# Step-by-Step Guide for E-commerce Platform Project

## 1. Project Setup and Architecture

### 1.1 Development Environment Setup
- Install necessary tools: **Java JDK**, **Node.js**, **npm**, **Docker**, and **MongoDB**.
- Set up **IntelliJ IDEA** or **VS Code** for the backend and **Angular CLI** for the frontend.

### 1.2 Microservices Architecture
- Create separate Spring Boot microservices for:
  - **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and role management.
  - **Product Service**: Handles CRUD operations for products.
  - **Media Service**: Manages media uploads and associations.
- Set up **Spring Cloud Eureka** for service discovery.
- Configure **Spring Cloud Gateway** for API routing.

### 1.3 Database Setup
- Set up individual **MongoDB** databases for each microservice (User, Product, and Media services).
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for remote databases, or Docker for local MongoDB instances.

### 1.4 Kafka Integration
- Install **Apache Kafka**.
- Configure Kafka topics for messaging between microservices (e.g., user events, product updates).
- Implement **Kafka Producers** and **Consumers** in microservices.

### 1.5 Docker Configuration
- Write **Dockerfiles** for each microservice to containerize them.
- Use **docker-compose.yml** to orchestrate services, including Kafka, MongoDB, and the microservices.

### 1.6 Frontend Setup
- Use **Angular CLI** to initialize the project.
- Create modules and services for authentication, user management, product listing, and media handling.


## 2. User Microservice Implementation

### 2.1 User Entity Design
- Create User entity with fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role (enum CLIENT/SELLER)`, and `avatar`.

### 2.2 User Registration & Authentication
- Implement endpoints for **signup** and **login** using **BCrypt** for password hashing.
- Generate **JWT tokens** for authentication and protect routes based on user roles (client/seller).

### 2.3 Profile Management
- Add profile endpoints to view/update **user profiles**.

### 2.4 Role-Based Access Control
- Use **Spring Security** to enforce seller-specific actions like product management and media upload.


## 3. Product Microservice Implementation

### 3.1 Product Entity Design
- Design Product entity with fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `quantity`, `userId`.

### 3.2 Product CRUD Operations
- Implement product CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with **role-based access control** to ensure only sellers can modify their own products.

### 3.3 Product Listing
- Develop endpoints to list products available in the database, viewable by clients and sellers.


## 4. Media Microservice Implementation

### 4.1 Media Entity Design
- Design Media entity with fields: `id`, `imagePath`, `productId`.

### 4.2 Media Upload Functionality
- Implement image upload endpoints with **file size constraints (max 2MB)** and allow only valid image types (JPG, PNG).

### 4.3 Media Retrieval and Management
- Create endpoints for sellers to manage (retrieve and delete) media files associated with their products.


## 5. Inter-Service Communication

### 5.1 Define Kafka Topics
- Create Kafka topics to handle events like user signup, product updates, and media associations.

### 5.2 Kafka Producers and Consumers
- Implement **Producers** to send messages when events (e.g., product creation) occur and **Consumers** to receive and process those messages across services.


## 6. Security Implementation

### 6.1 HTTPS Configuration
- Use **Let's Encrypt** for SSL certificates and configure the API Gateway to enforce HTTPS.

### 6.2 Input Validation
- Implement **Bean Validation (JSR 380)** for input validation across user registration, product creation, and media uploads.

### 6.3 Sensitive Data Protection
- Ensure **passwords are hashed** (e.g., using BCrypt) and sensitive data like tokens are not exposed in API responses.

### 6.4 CORS Configuration
- Set up **CORS policies** in the Gateway to allow requests from the frontend.


## 7. Error Handling and Validation

### 7.1 Global Exception Handling
- Implement a **GlobalExceptionHandler** for each microservice to handle application-wide errors and provide user-friendly error messages.

### 7.2 Custom Exceptions
- Define custom exceptions for scenarios like invalid media uploads or unauthorized product modification.

### 7.3 Request Validation
- Use **@Valid** annotation and **BindingResult** for request validation, ensuring clean input data.


## 8. Frontend Development

### 8.1 User Authentication
- Create **login** and **signup** forms with JWT token storage to authorize requests between frontend and backend.

### 8.2 Seller Dashboard
- Build a **product management dashboard** where sellers can create, update, and delete their products.
- Add a media upload section in the seller dashboard for image management.

### 8.3 Product Listing
- Display all products with basic information on a **Product Listing page** (accessible by all users).

### 8.4 Responsive Design
- Ensure the application is responsive using **Angular Material** or **Bootstrap**.


## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for key microservices components, including **user registration** and **product CRUD** operations.

### 9.2 Integration Tests
- Test inter-service communication, Kafka message flows, and database connections.

### 9.3 End-to-End Testing
- Simulate **user flows** from signup to product creation and media upload using tools like **Postman** and **Selenium**.

### 9.4 Security Testing
- Perform **penetration tests** for vulnerabilities (e.g., JWT authentication bypass, insecure media upload).


## 10. Documentation

### 10.1 API Documentation
- Use **Swagger** or **OpenAPI** to generate REST API documentation for each microservice.

### 10.2 README Files
- Create detailed README files for each microservice, explaining its functionality, setup instructions, and usage.

### 10.3 System Architecture Documentation
- Prepare diagrams (e.g., UML) showing **system architecture**, **data flow**, and **service interactions**.


## 11. CI/CD and Deployment

### 11.1 CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Implement a **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI** pipeline for automated building, testing, and deployment of microservices.

### 11.2 Deployment Environments
- Set up staging and production environments using **Docker Swarm** or **Kubernetes** for scaling microservices.

### 11.3 Monitoring and Logging
- Use **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and **Prometheus** with **Grafana** for application monitoring.


## 12. Final Audit Preparation

### 12.1 Verify Functionality
- Test user registration, product CRUD, and media uploads. Ensure roles (client/seller) are enforced correctly.

### 12.2 Check Security Measures
- Verify that **HTTPS** is enabled, passwords are hashed, and sensitive data is secured.

### 12.3 Test Error Handling
- Perform stress tests by simulating edge cases like file upload violations or unauthorized product modifications.

### 12.4 Review Code Quality
- Ensure adherence to best practices for Spring annotations, MongoDB data structures, and Angular code organization.

### 12.5 End-to-End Testing
- Conduct **final tests** across all services, ensuring smooth integration from frontend to backend.

### 12.6 Documentation Review
- Update all documentation (API, setup instructions, architecture diagrams) to ensure it's comprehensive and up-to-date.
